    <string name="info">Android by default uses the locale of the device to select the appropriate language dependent resources. And most of the time this behaviour is enough for common applications.

    \n\nLocale represents a language/country/variant combination. Locales are used to alter the presentation of information such as numbers or dates to suit the conventions in the region they describe.</string>
